/**
 * @brief Reduces a given word to its root form using stemming.
 * 
 * @details This function applies stemming to remove suffixes and normalize 
 * word forms. It helps in text preprocessing by converting different 
 * word variations into a consistent base form.
 * 
 * Example transformation:
 * \dot
 * digraph Stemming {
 *     node [shape=ellipse, style=filled, color=lightblue];
 *     "enjoying" -> "enjoy" [label="prune suffix '-ing'"];
 *     "running" -> "run" [label="prune suffix '-ing'"];
 *     "happier" -> "happy" [label="convert to root"];
 * }
 * \enddot
 * 
 * @param str The word to be stemmed.
 * @return The stemmed version of the input word.
