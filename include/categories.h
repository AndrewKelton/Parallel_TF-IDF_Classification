/**
 * @class Category
 * @brief Represents a category for classifying documents based on their content.
 * 
 * @details The `Category` class is responsible for determining and managing the category of a document 
 * by analyzing its terms and computing the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) 
 * scores for the terms. It maintains the most important terms in the category, which are ranked 
 * by their TF-IDF values.
 * 
 * The class allows retrieval of the most important terms, manages TF-IDF scores for all documents 
 * in the category, and supports efficient sorting and querying of the terms.
 * 
 * @note This class also handles serialization of category data to an output file for later use.
